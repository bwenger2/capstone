CSCC Capstone\
The files contained in this repository are a portion of the source code for my Columbus State Capstone project.\
This project took the place of an internship in my Software Development degree.\
It implemented Visual Basic for a graphical front-end, interacting with an MS Acess relational database on the back-end.\
The code which I am uploading here is a fair portion of my own work on the project, and I am releasing it as "Unlicensed".\
Credit for its parent project belongs to my Capstone team, \
without whom I would not have had the logistical, motivational, and creative structure within which I wrote this code.
